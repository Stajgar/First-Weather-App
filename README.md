# pixel-weather-app

## Description

The goal of this project was to create an application which fetches weather data of searched cities or based on data from browser geolocalization. Main features:
* search for weather data from desired city or web browser geolocation
* Fahrenheit to Celsius unit conversion
* display current weather (wind speed, precipitation, weather description)
* display weather forecast

## Design

Pixel Weather App is inspired by 90's Windows style. Vintage-looking background and pixelated icons are giving the project a retro vibe. Weather icons from Adobe Stock were recolored using Adobe Illustrator.

## Approach

Pixel Weather App utilises OpenWeather API to provide real time data about weather in searched places. Frontend layer was built using Javascript ES6 and Bootstrap - a full list of technology and tools used to create this project from design to implementation can be found below.
